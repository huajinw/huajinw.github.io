<p>I am a cell biologist by training, with more than 10 years of research experience in molecular and cellular biology, lipid metabolism, bioinformatics, and computational analysis of large biomedical datasets. I have deep understanding of research data. During my PhD studies at University of Alberta and postdoctoral research at Yale/Harvard,  I have collaborated with biologists, clinicians, and data scientists on many successful research projects. As a liaison librarian, I am passionate about helping the research community with their data needs, facilitating scientific data reuse and reproducibility, and educating the next generation of biomedical scientists. My current research focus is to engage various stake holders to build incentives and infrastructure for scientific rigor and data sharing, as well as developing data-driven approaches for academic services.</p>
