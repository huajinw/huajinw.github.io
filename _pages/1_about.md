I am a Cell Biologist turned information professional and open science advocate. As a Senior Librarian at <a href="https://www.library.cmu.edu"> Carnegie Mellon University Libraries</a>, I provide consultation and develop programs that help research communities make their research more open, reproducible, and reusable, foster collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, and engage stakeholders to build a healthy data ecosystem. My current research interest is on open science implementation and assessment, reproducibility and reuse of biomedical data, and AI-readiness of research data. 

I was a co-founder and Director of the <a href="https://www.library.cmu.edu/datapub/open-science">Open Science & Data Collaborations Program</a> at CMU. I also served a senior leadership role at the <a href="https://www.cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a> to drive culture change in research communities with technology, community building, incentives, policy, and thought leadership. 

I completed my PhD in Cell Biology at University of Alberta, postdoctoral research at Yale/Harvard, and independent research at Carnegie Mellon University. I have collaborated with biologists, clinicians, and data scientists on many successful research projects in areas spanning membrane trafficking, lipid metabolism, bioinformatics, and computational analysis of large biomedical datasets.
