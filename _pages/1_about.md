I am a Cell Biologist turned information professional and open science advocate. As a Senior Librarian at <a href="https://www.library.cmu.edu"> Carnegie Mellon University Libraries</a>, I foster relationships with academic departments, provide reserach consultation and training for students and faculty, and develop programs and initiatives that help research communities make their research more open, discoverable, reproducible, and reusable. My current resaerch interest is on open science implementation and assessment, resarech reproducibility, and building a healthy data ecosystem at the intersection of open science and AI. 

I am a co-founder and a former Director of the <a href="https://www.library.cmu.edu/datapub/open-science">Open Science & Data Collaborations Program</a> and the <a href="https://cmu-lib.github.io/data-colab/"> Data Collaborations Lab </a> at CMU. I also served a senior leadership role at the <a href="https://www.cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a> to drive culture change in research communities with technology, community building, training, and thought leadership. 

I completed my PhD in Cell Biology at University of Alberta and postdoctoral research at Yale and Harvard. At Carnegie Mellon, I conducted independent research as a faculty member at Biological Sciences before joining the Libraries, and have taken computer science and machine learning courses for credit. My expertise as a scientist spans membrane trafficking, lipid metabolism, cell imaging, and computational analysis of high throughput and multi-omics data.
