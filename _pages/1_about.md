I am a Research Liaison at <a href="https://www.library.cmu.edu"> Carnegie Mellon University Libraries</a> and Program Director for <a href="https://www.library.cmu.edu/datapub/open-science">Open Science & Data Collaborations</a>. I am passionate about helping the research community with data needs, fostering collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, facilitating scientific data reuse and reproducibility, and engaging various stake holders to build a healthy data ecosystem. My current research focus is to build tools, infrastructure and incentives for scientific rigor and data sharing, and to develop data-driven approaches for academic services.

Before joining the libraries, I completed my PhD in Cell Biology at University of Alberta, postdoctoral research at Yale/Harvard, and independent research at Carnegie Mellon University. I have collaborated with biologists, clinicians, and data scientists on many successful research projects in areas spanning membrane trafficking, lipid metabolism, bioinformatics, and computational analysis of large biomedical datasets.
