I'm back at Carnegie Mellon! :sparkles: :sparkling_heart: Almost everyday, I find myself amazed at the unique character that the CMU community has - passion, curiosity, determination, ambition, down to earth. I look forward to continuing to work with devoted colleagues and support our students and faculty on their journey to groundbreaking ideas and innovation.
